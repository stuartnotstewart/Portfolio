                        <h2>About the project</h2>
                        <p>In early 2022, I took part in the redesign initiative at Pixel Productions for Redmond Life's live e-commerce site. This consists on revamping current pages that populate the site; some new pages of interest made were product releases, a gift program for customers, a social media resource page for affiliates and seasonal pages.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cs-section">
                        <h2>The problem</h2>
                        <p>Because the design was outdated on Redmond Life’s e-commerce site, users were having a difficult experience navigating through different pages, acquiring information about their favorite product resulted cumbersome.

                        In order to expand to new target audiences, the website missed the mark on making an impact on current and potential customers, not establishing a good first impression to a site dedicated to sell health products.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cs-section">
                        <h2>The solution</h2>
                        <div class="cs-section-child">
                            <h3>Optimize page layout</h3>
                            <p>Implement “mobile first” approach for new and current pages, given the fact that more than 67% of users navigate Redmond Life on mobile devices, where it was initially designed for desktop primarily and the mobile experience was left for last.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="cs-section-child">
                            <h3>Information architecture overhaul</h3>
                            <p>Initially, the structure of the content within the header which houses the navigation system of the site was misleading users to unwanted pages. Through constant iteration, I established a hierarchy of pages and flow of the site.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="cs-section-child">
                            <h3>Create a design system</h3>
                            <p>Create a standard, taking into consideration accessibility and screen sizes, for the visual identity of Redmond Life. This includes updating the current interface with a language that is familiar for current customers and easy to understand for new users.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cs-section">
                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>Identify the pages with most traffic and state sections that get most interaction, what relates with the user and what makes them identify with the brand.
                        
                        <br>

                        Test the current checkout process to compare  the competitor’s, what works and what needs to go without sacrificing important steps or information.
                        
                        <br>

                        With affiliates, establish pages that show the human side of the products and its impact on people.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cs-section">
                        <h2>Information architecture</h2>
                        <p>After the analysis, I made a proposal of a new information architecture for the site based on feedback stating that users were unable to find content.
                        
                        <br>

                        New pages were added to the flow to make sure that the overall structure made sense even with new content being added by the month.
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        This helped visualize what the users were being presented in a bird's eye view and if we needed to make any changes for any reason, instead of tasking development to make a change based on a hypothesis, the team and I could test the new change in the flow.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cs-section">
                        <h2>Interaction design</h2>
                        <p>Next, I was tasked with making mid/hi-fidelity wireframes of the initial pages to apply the redesign taking into account the new changes proposed from the information architecture flow from earlier.
                        
                        <br>

                        These were adapted for a mobile-first experience to assure the markup of the content would be applicable for tablet/folding devices and desktop screen sizes.
                        
                        <br>

                        The team and I would review the new design options, iterate through necessary changes while consulting the viability of development for the new visual approach on the pages.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cs-section">
                        <h2>User interface design</h2>
                        <p>Upon the project grew bigger by the week, I decided on making a design system moving forward, afterwards making a consult with the client on the use cases and benefits with the client.
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        The Redmond Life brand already had its typeface as well as color palette for their products and website, so I implemented these in the system while resembling similar traits from their products and social media for there to be a visual identity throughout the site.
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        This helped standardize the new design language for pages to come and for the current active pages through the use of a component library. This library was optimized to represent the brand as well as abiding to accessibility standards, viability of development and offer a user experience that improved the current.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cs-section">
                        <h2>Iterations</h2>
                        <p>Once the foundation of the design system was set an approved, it allowed the redesign process of current pages to be ready for reviewal in a shorter time frame and as new pages were implemented had the same effect.

                        <br>
                        
                        Great benefit for the developers to maintain and implement existing components on all pages.
                        
                        <br>

                        Unified in a visual sense all of the pages with a refresh of its design and new information architecture as the project progressed.
                        
                        <br>

                        As new pages were added to the site, I would use existing components and if needed new changes to add to the design system.</p>
