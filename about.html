                <p>A simple, yet complicated introvert based in Guatemala. Someone who loves technology since a kid and a curiosity to know how and why digital products are made.</p>

                <h2>First and foremost, Christian.</h2>
                <p>For the longest time, I was religious only on Sundays when I went to church. Now I devote my time and life to my savior Jesus Christ through reading the word every day and abiding by the path He has prepared for me.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Next, a designer</h2>
                <p>Without knowing what graphic design was, I switched careers while in university where two years in I learned what the terms user interface and experience was. To be fair, the curriculum only taught user interface on two courses but it was enough for me to get curious and learn on my own.</p>

                <h2>Finally, an avid book reader</h2>
                <p>I used to hate reading since elementary, with boring titles that would bore the heck out of a kid it was no wonder that up to the age of 22 I had only read 2 books in my life. Now as of writing this page, I have read more than 30 books and I canâ€™t pass a day without reading.</p>
